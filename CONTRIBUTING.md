# Contributing

Contributions are welcome and an easy way to get started is to file an issue. Make sure to be as descriptive about your problem as possible. Try to explain what you have tried, what you expected and what the actual outcome was. Give additional information about your java and weka version, as well as platform specific details that could be relevant. 

If you are going to contribute to the codebase, you should fork this repository, create a separate branch on which you commit your changes and file a pull request. A well explained how-to is described [here](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962).

If you have new ideas for possible extensions, either file an issue or submit a pull request.
